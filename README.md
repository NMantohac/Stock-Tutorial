## Technologies

    * Node
    * NPM Express
    * React
    * React-Bootstrap
    * MySql
    * API (Alpha Vantage) (API Docs)
    * GitHub
    * Heroku
    * Travis CI/ESlint
    * Rechart

## Challenges

* Working with React on a larger project created a lot of early confusion with class components , functional components, routes and API calls.

* Dealing with our databases and using the correct queries involving our API calls and our database.

* Deciding on a react chart (npm package) -> canvas.js/chart, react-charts, recharts

* Trending -> Displaying the data from the API call as a chart (specific format)

* Using href from React bootstrap was a bit challenge. After deploying to heroku it doesnâ€™t work. We have to replace href with link tags.
